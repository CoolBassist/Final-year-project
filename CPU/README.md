# CPU

To run this CPU, you will need the Digital software which can be downloaded from https://github.com/hneemann/Digital. 

To run a program on the CPU, open the `main.dig`, rightclick on the `RAMROM` component, and click on the `open circuit` button. Then rightclick on the `ROM` component and click `edit`. From here you can either enter machine language instructions, or go `file->open` to load a hex file. After it has been loaded. Click okay, and save the `RAMROM` component. Go back onto the `main.dig` file, and press the run triangle at the top of the screen. The simulation has now started, now flip the dipswitch on the bottom left corner to turn on the CPU.
